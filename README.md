# YouTube Data Analysis Documentation

## Introduction
This document provides an overview and documentation of a Python script designed to analyze data from YouTube channels and videos using the YouTube Data API. The script retrieves channel statistics, video details, performs data cleaning and analysis, and conducts sentiment analysis on comments for a given video.

## Dependencies
- `google-api-python-client`: A Python library to interact with Google's discovery-based APIs.
- `pandas`: A powerful data manipulation library for Python.
- `seaborn` and `matplotlib.pyplot`: Data visualization libraries for generating various plots and charts.
- `nltk`: Natural Language Toolkit for text processing tasks such as tokenization and stopword removal.
- `wordcloud`: A library for creating word clouds from text data.
- `dotenv`: A library for loading environment variables from a `.env` file.
- `requests`: A library for making HTTP requests.

## Setup
1. **Install Dependencies**: Ensure that the required Python libraries are installed. You can install them using pip:
   ```
   !pip install --upgrade google-api-python-client pandas seaborn matplotlib nltk wordcloud dotenv requests textblob
   ```

2. **Obtain API Key**: You need to obtain an API key from the Google Cloud Console to access the YouTube Data API. Make sure to enable the YouTube Data API v3 for your project.

3. **Environment Variables**: Store your API key in a `.env` file:
   ```
   YOUTUBE_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

## Script Overview
The script performs the following tasks:

1. **Import Libraries**: Imports necessary Python libraries for data retrieval, analysis, and visualization.

2. **Define API Key and Channel IDs**: Specifies the API key for accessing the YouTube Data API and defines the channel IDs for which data will be retrieved.

3. **Function Definitions**:
   - `get_channel_stats()`: Retrieves statistics for specified YouTube channels.
   - `get_video_ids()`: Retrieves video IDs from the uploads playlist of a channel.
   - `get_video_details()`: Retrieves detailed information for each video.
   - `get_comment_sentiment()`: Analyzes sentiment of YouTube comments.

4. **Data Retrieval and Processing**:
   - Retrieves channel statistics and video details using the defined functions.
   - Cleans and preprocesses the data, including handling missing values, converting data types, and extracting additional features.

5. **Data Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Generates various visualizations including bar plots, scatter plots, violin plots, and word clouds to analyze video and comment data.
   - Conducts sentiment analysis on comments using TextBlob library and visualizes sentiment distribution.

6. **Export Data**:
   - Saves the analyzed data to a CSV file for further analysis or reporting.

## Usage
- Ensure that you have set up the necessary environment variables and dependencies as described in the Setup section.
- Run the script in a Python environment such as Jupyter Notebook or a Python script editor.
- Modify the script as needed to analyze data from specific YouTube channels or videos.
